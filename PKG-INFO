Description: spnav: a ctypes wrapper for libspnav, a Space Navigator 3D mouse client
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        The spnav module provides a Python interface to the libspnav C
        library, which allows you to read events from a Space Navigator 3D
        mouse on Linux systems.  These input devices simultaneously report
        linear force and rotational torque applied by the user to the device,
        along with button events. See:
        
                http://www.3dconnexion.com/products/spacenavigator.html
        
        for more information about the 3D navigator.
        
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        
        As a general prerequisite to using the spnav module, you need to
        install libspnav and spacenavd, available from:
        
                http://spacenav.sourceforge.net/
        
        Then you need to connect a supported 3D mouse to your system.
        Spacenavd supports USB devices with no configuration, but serial-based
        devices will need a /etc/spnavrc configuration file.
        
        The spnav module requires ctypes, which is standard in Python 2.5 and
        later, although I have only tested spnav with Python 2.7.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The spnav module installs like any other python packages.  You can
        install the package from the unpacked source directory by running
        
          sudo python setup.up install
        
        Quick Test
        ----------
        
        To see if your installation is working, spnav comes with a test script
        in the module:
        
          python -m spnav
        
        This will print motion and button events from your Space Navigator to
        the console.
